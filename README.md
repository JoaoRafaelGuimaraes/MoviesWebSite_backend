#backend

This project's main function was to be the final part of a selection project for a Junior Company selection process, specifically at the company CatiJr. This website, called "Teacher's List", should allow users to log in and register, so that they can access a number of films and favorite the ones they are most interested in.

My participation in this project was the joint development (with 3 other members) of the backend systems and functions, such as login routes, authentication and interaction with the TMDb movie API.
